# Cyber-Risk-Analysis-Frameworks

## About Me
Hi, my name is Ian! I am an aspiring Cybersecurity graduate with a great passion for everything tech and highly  motivated in displaying my growth of knowledge in Cyber Risk Management, Governance, and mitigating security threats. 

This GitHub repository serves as a collection of my research, learning, and practical applications in developing cybersecurity frameworks.

My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge and improve my skills in cyber risk assessment, governance frameworks, and compliance standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF).

## Repository Overview
This repository includes:
‚úîÔ∏è Summaries of key cybersecurity risk frameworks
‚úîÔ∏è Templates for security policies and governance documents
‚úîÔ∏è Risk assessment methodologies and case studies

I hope this serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in cyber risk management. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! üöÄ

## Cybersecurity Policy & Governance Templates

### Key Policies Included:
1. **Incident Response Plan**  
   This template outlines the steps to take in the event of a cybersecurity incident. It covers everything from identification and containment to recovery and post-incident analysis.
   
2. **Access Control Policy**  
   Defines the access levels and controls for users, ensuring that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals. It includes guidelines for both physical and logical access control mechanisms.
   
3. **Risk Management Framework**  
   Aligned with **ISO 27001** and **NIST**, this framework provides a structured approach to managing and mitigating cybersecurity risks. It outlines risk identification, assessment, treatment, and continuous monitoring.

4. **Phishing Awareness Policy**  
   This policy focuses on educating users about phishing attacks, identifying common signs, and implementing preventive measures to reduce the risk of falling victim to phishing schemes.

5. **Secure Software Development Policy**  
   Aimed at integrating security best practices into the software development lifecycle (SDLC), this policy ensures that security considerations are made at every stage, from design to deployment.
