# About Me

Hi, my name is Ian! I am an aspiring Cybersecurity graduate with a strong passion for cyber risk management, governance, and mitigating security threats.

This GitHub repository is a collection of my research, learning, and practical applications in cyber risk frameworks, security policies, and governance strategies.

My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge and improve my skills in cyber risk assessment, governance frameworks, and compliance standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF).
