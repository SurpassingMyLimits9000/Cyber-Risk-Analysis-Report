# Cyber-Risk-Analysis-Frameworks
About me... 
<br /> Hi, my name is Ian! I am an aspiring Cybersecurity graduate with a strong passion in everything tech but specifically Cyber risk management, governance, and mitigating security threats. This github respitory serves as a collection of my research, learning and practical application in developing cybersecurity frameworks. 

My goal is to demonstrate my knowledge and improve my skills in cyber risk assessment, governance frameworks, and compliance standards such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and the Secure Controls Framework (SCF).

This repository includes:\
✔️ Summaries of key cybersecurity risk frameworks\
✔️ Templates for security policies and governance documents\
✔️ Risk assessment methodologies and case studies

I hope this serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in cyber risk management. Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! 🚀
